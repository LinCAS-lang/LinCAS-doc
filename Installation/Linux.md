# Installing

On the command line:

  * Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/max-codeware/crLinCAS`
  * Change folder with `cd crLinCAS`
  * Run the installer with the command `./install.sh`
  
You will be asked to insert your password. This is needed to create the `/usr/lib/LinCAS` folder and to copy the binaries into `/usr/bin`
