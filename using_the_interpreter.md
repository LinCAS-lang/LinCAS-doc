# Using the interpreter

## Using the interpreter

When you [install](https://github.com/LinCAS-lang/LinCAS-doc/tree/0a9d3aaf965ca1d4339c4fb8b8bcc4c3528eafbe/Using_the_interpreter/..Installation/Installation.md) the interpreter, a binary file is generated and copied into /usr/bin folder to be available from the command line.

In the next section the symbol `$` is used to denote the command line.

## Running programs

To run a program you can simply invoke `lincas` with a filemane

```text
$ lincas some_program.lc
```

LinCAS files ends with .lc extension, but it can be omitted.

Alternatively you ca use a shebang, that is adding as first line of your program the code `#! /usr/bin/lincas`. Than you can simply run your file just typing on your command line `$ ./my_program.lc` ensuring it has the executable privileges.

## Other options

To see the possible options of the interpreter, type `$ lincas -h`

```text
$ lincas -h
Usage : lincas [options] [filename] [arguments]

options:
    -t  --tokens   Displays the tokens generated by the scanner
                   (the program won't be executed)
    -a  --ast      Displays the AST generated by the parser
    -i  --iseq     Displays the compiled bytecode
    -n  --no-exec  Suppresses the execution of the program
```
