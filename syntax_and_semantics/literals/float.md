# Float

This type represents all the decimal numbers. A float is represented by an optional `+` or `-` sign followed by digits, a dot and other digits.

```coffeescript
1.0
124.67
+10.9
-85.3
```

This kind of literal has a limit on the digits \(due to internal conversions\), so some float number might raise some error. This problem will be fixed as soon as possible.
