# Integer

This type encloses all the integer numbers. They are represented by an optional `+` or `-` sign followed by digits

```coffeescript
1
1433
98
+55
-265
```

This kind of literal has a limit on the digits \(due to internal conversions\), so some integer number might raise some error. This problem will be fixed as soon as possible.
