# Assignment

Assignments adopts the colon-equal \(:=\) convention

```ruby
local     := "bazz" # Assignment to a local variable
@instance := 155    # Assignment to an instance variable
```

LinCAS also provides some sintax sugar for assignments and operators to make the code shorter and comfortable:

```coffeescript
a += 1  # Same as a := a + 1

# The above code is valid for the following opertors:
# + - * / \ ** %
```
