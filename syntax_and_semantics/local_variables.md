# Local variables

Local variables are created when they are first assigned. Their names can begin with a lowcase or capital letter, but the suggested convention is to use the lowcase option, in order to avoid collisions with constants

```coffeescript
local     := 12
local_var := "with underscore"
```

Local variables can always be reassigned
