# Comments

LinCAS supports both single line comments and multiline comments.

Single line comments are identified by the `#` character

```ruby
# This is a single line comment
```

While multiline comments are enclosed between `/* */` \(similarly to C/C++ languages\)

```c
/*
  This
  is 
  a 
  multiline
  comment
*/
```
