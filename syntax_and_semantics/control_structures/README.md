# Control structures

LinCAS provides different structures to control the program flow.

Control structures usually make use of condition which can assume truthy or falsey values.

A **Truthy** value is a value considered as true in statements like `if`, `while`, `until`, while a falsey value is a value considered as false.

In LinCAS `null` and `false` are considered falsey values, all the others as truthy.
