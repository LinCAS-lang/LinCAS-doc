# The program

## The program

The program is an instance of class Object where it is possible to define method, classes modules and use other components of the language.

Local variables defined in a file are visible only in there.

## Main program

The main program is the code you execute first. In other words it is the file you pass to the interpreter, since LinCAS doesn't need any special `main` function.
