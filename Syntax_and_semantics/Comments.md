# Comments

LinCAS supports both single line comments and multiline comments.


Single line comments are identified by the `#` character

```Ruby
# This is a single line comment
```

While multiline comments are enclosed between `/* */` (similarly to C/C++ languages)

```C
/*
  This
  is 
  a 
  multiline
  comment
*/
```
