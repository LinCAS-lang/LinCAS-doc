# Introduction

This repository hosts the official documentation for the LinCAS programming language, which is available [here](https://lincas-lang.gitbook.io/lincas/) on GitBook.

This user manual takes inspiration from the [Crystal-book](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-book), and it is still being edited.
