The LinCAS programming language's porposal is to unify a flexible language with a computer algebra system and plotting libraries, to create a powerful tool for computation.

This ptoject is in pre alpha stage, and still require a lot of work to make it stronger, so some little sintax element could change to best fit the language usability
